The HRManagerAgent is the master orchestrator for the HRIS system that acts as the central coordinator, analyzing incoming HR requests and intelligently delegating them to specialized sub-agents (EmployeeRecordsAgent, LeaveManagementAgent, OnboardingAgent, and QueryAgent), while managing complex multi-step workflows, aggregating responses, and ensuring smooth operation across all HR functions with proper error handling and access control.
